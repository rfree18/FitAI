# FitAI
This is a simple application that serves as a demo for FitAI at the Innovention competition at NYU. It measures various metrics during a workout by connecting to a Metawear sensor.

## Instructions
To properly run this demo, the CocoaPods need to be installed first. Open the terminal and go to the project directory. Run 'pod install' and wait a minute or two for it to complete. Open up the .xcworkspace file instead of the .xcproject file. Build and run the project on a device.
*Note*: This demo cannot be run in the simulator. Doing so will cause linker errors.
